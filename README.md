FloodIt! Student Support Code

Revision: Fall 2023

Hope I am doing this right

f(n) = nlog(n) roughly fits the time complexity graph


It is o(n) because it needs to go through each item in flooded_list

This does not match the graph results so I must be wrong, but it is the most similar graph to o(nlogn)

I used lists for my function, I think it runs pretty well but maybe using linked lists or some other data structure would have been faster
